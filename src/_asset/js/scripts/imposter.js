    imposter_fear_intro = "The <strong>IMPOSTER</strong> archetype stems from a core fear of being seen as incompetent. At times you may over focus on being seen as smart and having all the answers yourself, using your exceptional drive to overachieve. Therefore, you may find it difficult to receive feedback that you are wrong, or you may overreact when you feel uninformed. This is when the IMPOSTER fights, rather than listening with an open mind. Strong action orientation and decisiveness mean the IMPOSTER can step in too much, rather than trusting their team. They may find it difficult to control an anger reaction, causing a team to shut down and feel their ideas are dismissed.",
