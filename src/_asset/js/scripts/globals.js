    partTwo = "It’s a part of being human to have fears. Fear is natural in the business world, where leaders continually worry about losing out to the competition or making a crucial mistake. The key is to have the right balance of fear in motivating yourself and others, and not to let your fears bring out the worst in you. When leaders can identify and engage in conversation about their fears, it can be a turning point in their leadership journey. We’ve learned that the best leaders share their fears with their teams, and it often begins a transformation in the team. These conversations result in high trust and transparency, and translate into TEAMS THAT GET RESULTS.",
